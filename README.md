# Lazy Hacker

This project pretends to offer a service similar to _metasploit_ which allows the user to scan a certain webpage looking for **vulnerabilities**. This tool is supposed to be user-friendly, in order to offer a  quick life-saver service for the ones who are not very related to security but even though concerned.

But remember! Don't rely your proffesional software security in fast scanning, ask a proffesional!

In the future we want to offer a higher scanning service with a curating tool for domains and certain organizations. **_Unsecure pages, beware!_**

Our service pretends to rely in open software and different tools, such as:

1. Python and ruby for the scripts
2. MongoDB for the databases
3. vue.js and deepstreamhub for the realtime data
4. nmap for the vulnerabilities scanning
